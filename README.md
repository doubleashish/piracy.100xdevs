This was a "Jokey" project about pirating Harkirat's cohort lectures, as he has a reputation of hacking websites of others.
But, even if it's a joke, I can't deny that it is propogating piracy/screenrecording.
Which is why I decided to not publish the core code.
Only information available in this repo is the overview of how it could be done, because I reseached about it.
Again, these technologies are public and should be used with due diligence.

PS: It is practically not possible because one has to analyse >200k frames, and tesseract.js would cause issues as well while performing OCR.
